one episode could be one recommendation
or spanning k no. of recommendations

actions - what app agent recommended
rewards - (-1, +1), (0, +1), (-1, 0) 
	- whether user liked the recommendation or not

state - could be the set of apps remaining
	- hence our problem becomes a deterministic one

what we know is that rl has done much better than traditional ml/dl approches in solving games.
so we wnat to figure out whether framing the recsys process as a game might be helpful in making 
the recsys better
